Conceptual Steps of Selection Sort:
Start with Unsorted Dataset: Begin with an unordered dataset, represented as an array. This array contains elements in arbitrary order.

Identify Minimum Element: Iterate through the unsorted portion of the array to identify the minimum element.

Swap with First Unsorted Element: Once the minimum element is found, swap it with the leftmost element of the unsorted portion. This effectively extends the sorted portion of the array.

Repeat for Remaining Unsorted Elements: Continue this process for the remaining unsorted elements, selecting the minimum element and swapping it with the leftmost element of the unsorted portion.

Continue Until Sorted: Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is sorted. As each iteration progresses, the sorted portion of the array grows, and the unsorted portion shrinks until all elements are in sorted order.

Key Principles Emphasized:
Selection of Minimum Element: The primary principle driving Selection Sort is the repeated selection of the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array. This selection process ensures that the smallest elements are moved to the beginning of the array, gradually building the sorted portion.

In-place Sorting: Selection Sort sorts the array in-place, meaning it doesn't require additional space other than the input array itself. This makes it efficient in terms of memory usage.

Efficiency: Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. It involves nested loops to traverse the array and select the minimum element, making it less efficient than other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or QuickSort. However, it has relatively fewer swaps compared to algorithms like Bubble Sort, making it more practical for small to medium-sized datasets.

Stability: Selection Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it does not necessarily preserve the relative order of equal elements. This may or may not be desirable depending on the specific requirements of the sorting task.

Comparison with Other Sorting Algorithms:
Efficiency: Selection Sort is generally less efficient than more advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, QuickSort, or HeapSort, especially for large datasets. Its time complexity of O(n^2) makes it less suitable for sorting very large datasets.

Applicability: Selection Sort is suitable for small to medium-sized datasets or situations where simplicity and minimal memory usage are prioritized over speed. It may be preferred in scenarios where additional memory allocation is limited or prohibited.
